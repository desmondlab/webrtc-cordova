//config.js
//This class is where you set your Ionic Configurations using Ionic's ionicConfigProvider.
//Ionic automatically takes platform configurations into account to adjust things like what transition style to use and whether tab icons should show on the top or bottom.
//For example, iOS will move forward by transitioning the entering view from right to center and the leaving view from center to left.
//However, Android will transition with the entering view going from bottom to center, covering the previous view, which remains stationary.
//It should be noted that when a platform is not iOS or Android, then it’ll default to iOS. So if you are developing on a desktop browser, it’s going to take on iOS default configs.
//Taken from Ionic Documentation on $ionicConfigProvider. http://ionicframework.com/docs/api/provider/$ionicConfigProvider/

angular.module('App').config(function($ionicConfigProvider) {
  //Define your configs here.
});
